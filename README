* INSTRUCTIONS *

To use my website, I implemented an array of set movies that can be used to test the tracker.
In future, I hope to intergrate an API such as IMDB or othe movie databases, to expand the range of movies and availability for users.

To toggle the type card to appear, add in movies and specify the genres. 
After adding a few in, the code will read what genre you most commonly watch and determine a type card for you.
Refresh the page to update this after adding movies.
Ideally in future I would like to add more conditionals to create more nuanced movie personality types.

* RESPONSIVENESS *
I designed for Desktop first (Particularly 1440px Ã— 900px), as I intend the database to be used following having watched a new movie, with intent to log it in. It is also more common users utilise desktop as their primary movie watching experience due to the large screen size, internet connectivity and overall health benefits related to ergonmics and long term screen usage.

The secondary mobile layout is designed for the Iphone 14 pro max.

* MOVIE ARRAY *
Movies to test website:
- Jurassic Park
- Avengers
- Tangled
- Spirited Away
- Forrest Gump
- Anastasia
- Die Hard
- Mean Girls
- Princess Diaries
- Interstellar
- Howls Moving Castle

* ADD NEW MOVIE POP UP *
I designed this pop up that will call the toggleNewPopup() when clicked and call removeNewPopup() when the close button is clicked.
I made the pop up in CSS by scratch in order to accommodate the form functions I wanted in the format I desired. In here I put in my user inputs, where when the user writes a movie that is from the list, it will fill in the director, year, and poster associated with the film.

From there users can input the genres they believe the movie best fit under, a score based on theor enjoyment of the movie, and a comment on the movie.

Once this is submitted, it is saved into local storage under formDataArray.

Reset button clears all fields on popUp as accounted by function clearForm.

* STAR RATING *
I used this source to help me start up the star rating interactive animation, then contributed my own code to make the rating clickable and for it to hold the color once clicked.

* CHECK MARK AND RADIO BUTTONS *
Similarly I applied some code from this source to style my radio and checkmark buttons more nicely.

* LOCAL MOVIE DATABASE *
By saving the form submissions as an object in the array, I could reorder, display, and remove form submissions as I pleased without them interfering with one another.
In the object, the user inputs were split off as different attributes, such as title and image, in order to make it easier to pull out the object entries to display on the website.

* MOVIE SUBMISSION CARDS *
This part was tricky, I had to create card elements from something that didnt initially exist, though needed to exist after an entry is submitted. I found a source online (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) that went through creating elements in Javascript within functions, etc. I looped through each submission and created divs and text elements to build off css in order to make the cards shown on the page.

In order to add css styling to each attribute in the object, I made an if statement that went through each attribute by name. 

* SORTING THE ARRAY *
I created 3 different options for Sorting the database content.

1. A to Z
In order to make it easier for the user to navigate a specific movie in the database, providing an alphabetical sorting option made sense.
2. Most recent
To view the database based on when content was last submitted. This can be applied in situations where the user has made a mistake and wants to delete their last entry or when the user wants to view.
3. Highest Rating
This could be applied for users viewing their friend's and family's lists. In sharing their movie interests, knowing their most enjoyed movies is ideal in understanding their taste profile.

* DETERMINING TYPE CARD BASED ON PRIMARY GENRE WATCHED *
I created a function that counts every instance a genre is mentioned in the form submissions. I had to complete it this way because each submission had the possibility of multiple genres, hence it could easily skip over genres that were not mentioned first for that object. I acknowledge that there are a lot more than five genre in the world of movies and film although in the circumstance of the assignment, I chose to limit this number due to the limitations of the movie array beng unable to fully demonstrate a longer list of genres.

Despite this, I still believe my websites fully demostrates what I wanted it to in the terms of a shareable personality type movie database as something that is fun and helpful in an environment where watching movies with friends and family often becomes a stressful task given that streaming sites like Netflix and Stan overwhelm us with choice. It give opprtunity to share what you have watched, your taste and also strike up conversation about your watching habits.

* TYPE CARD ILLUSTRATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS *
The type cards correspond to the highest amount of instances a genre appears within the array. Each type comes with a title, illustration and description highlighting some traits that align with the average watcher of that genre.

I digitally drew the illustrations in Procreate (popular art app on iPad).

* DESIGN CHANGES *
I made some design changes from the initial wireframes.

These include:
- Showing the contents of the card onto the main page instead of a pop up.
Since the content inputs didn't take much space, it didn't make sense to make the user click through each poster in order to access the information they inputted. By having the card format, the user can explore the ratings and comments more easily.

- Redesigning the add new movie button
Due to the design implementation above, making the button a seperate element made sense as I didnt want it to consume too much unneccessary space and also, it allowed me to make the button more descriptive instead of just having a symbol to indicate its purpose.

- Mobile layout
In order to accomodate the changes above and the single page architecture requirement that was outlined in the assignment page, I kept the layout quite similar to the website. The main purpose of having a phone layout for this website is primarily for sharing your taste profile with others, so having the type card take about 75% of the screen with the list being scrollable, it would still serve the function of being able to add movies on the go, although this is not a priority for the mobile layout.

* AI USAGE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS *
I used ChaptGPT to help generate the type descriptions, some css suggestions and also assist with debugging the sort code function and pop up function.
The prompts I used were:
- "Can you write a description for a personality type that watches lots of comedy?"
- "Could you look at this code and show me why its not working? (Insert code snippet)"
- "Why isnt the closeBtn button showing up? (Insert code snippet)"
- "How do I create an background overlay for a pop up on a website?"
- "How do i make the content in the listHead div stack vertically?"

PS.
Lots of gratitude to the contributors at MDN Web Docs and W3Schools. This code simply will not exist without them.
