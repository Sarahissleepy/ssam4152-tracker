Welcome to my tracker website!!

To use my website, I implemented an array of set movies that can be used to test the tracker.
In future, I hope to intergrate an API such as IMDB or othe movie databases, to expand the range of movies and availability for users.

To toggle the type card to appear, add in movies and specify the genres. 
After adding a few in the code will read what genre you most commonly watch and determine a type card for you.
Refresh the page to update this after adding movies.
Ideally in future I would like to add more conditionals to create more nuanced movie personality types.
